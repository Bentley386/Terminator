# Terminator

A term scheduling web application made using the Asp.NET MVC framework. 

The project is a part of the mojedelo.com hackathon, where we were required to create a term scheduling application for the warehousing company "Lorem-Ipsum". The service allows customers to reserve terms for their deliveries, which the warehouse workers then process. 

The requirements and functionalities of the web application were mostly predetermined by the hackathon organizers. A presentation of the project is in "Overview.pdf" file.
